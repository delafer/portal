Feature Modules — In angular application, Feature modules are going to have have features which is going to be provided by the application. (for example CustomerModule, OrdersModule, ProductsModule, ShippingModule).

A feature module is an ordinary Angular module for all intents and purposes, except the fact that isn’t the root module.

A feature module delivers a cohesive set of functionality focused on a specific application need such as a user workflow, routing, or forms. While you can do everything within the root module, feature modules help you partition the app into focused areas. A feature module collaborates with the root module and with other modules through the services it provides and the components, directives, and pipes that it shares.
